## Built With

### Front End

- JavaScript
- React
- Bootstrap

### Back End

- PostgreSQL

## More Ideas

- Authentication with user sessions.
- Finish out the nav bar.
- Drag and drop for sort functionality.
- Show page where you can add more data for a car, such as engine size and any custom parts in the cars.

## Issues

### Roadblock

- Getting the DOM to update when adding or editing a vehicle with out having to refresh the page.
- Passing information between react classes.

### Wins

- Getting the Edit button toggle functionality to only toggle the selected entry.
